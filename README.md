If you use Homebrew, you have probably forgotten to run `brew update && brew upgrade` for weeks at a time. TopOff checks quietly in the background, shows outdated packages from the menu bar, and lets you update with one click.

## Features

- **One-click updates** — Run `brew update && brew upgrade` from your menu bar
- **Automatic update checking** — Periodically checks for outdated packages in the background
- **Smart icon status** — Full mug when up-to-date, half-full when updates are available, animated spinner when actively updating
- **Real-time progress** — See exactly which package is being updated as it happens — click the menu bar during updates to watch live
- **Package details at a glance** — See outdated package names and version changes directly in the menu
- **Selective updates** — Update or skip individual packages
- **Greedy mode** — Optionally include apps that handle their own updates (Chrome, Slack, etc.) in both scheduled checks and upgrades
- **Auto cleanup** — Automatically runs `brew cleanup` after upgrades to free disk space
- **Deep cache prune** — Manually run `brew cleanup --prune=all` with a confirmation step when you want to reclaim more Homebrew cache space
- **Admin retry for protected packages** — If a cask needs admin access, TopOff prompts for your password and retries automatically
- **Update history** — View recently updated packages with version changes
- **Configurable check interval** — Check every hour, 4 hours (default), 12 hours, 24 hours, or manually
- **Launch at login** — Always have TopOff ready
- **Automatic retry on network restore** — If the app launches without internet (e.g., at startup before WiFi connects), it automatically checks for updates once connectivity is restored
- **Update notifications** — Checks GitHub for new releases on launch and periodically while running
- **See what changed** — View upgraded packages and freed disk space in the menu

## Screenshots

The menu bar icon tells you at a glance if updates are available:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Full mug | All packages are up-to-date |
| Half-full mug | Updates are available (needs a refill!) |
| Spinning arrows | Checking for updates or updating — click to see live progress |
| Checkmark | Update completed successfully |

## Installation

### Download (Recommended)

1. Download the [latest DMG](https://github.com/ihazgithub/TopOff/releases/latest/download/TopOff-v1.8.2.dmg)
2. Open the DMG and drag TopOff to your Applications folder
3. **First launch:** macOS will block the app since it's not notarized. To open it:
   - Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
   - Scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the TopOff message
   - You only need to do this once (and again after each update)

### Build from Source

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `TopOff/TopOff.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run (⌘R)

### Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed

## Usage

1. Click the beer mug icon in your menu bar
2. See which packages need updating with version details
3. Choose **Update All**, **Update All (Greedy)**, or update individual packages
4. Watch the icon animate while updates run
5. Check the menu to see what was upgraded and how much disk space was freed

### Options

All preferences are available under the **Options** submenu:

- **Launch at Login** — Start TopOff when you log in
- **Auto Cleanup** — Automatically runs `brew cleanup` after upgrades (on by default). Disable to use the manual Clean Up button instead.
- **Greedy Mode** — Always check and update everything, including apps that auto-update themselves (off by default — see [Greedy Mode explained](#whats-the-difference-between-update-all-and-greedy))
- **Check Interval** — How often TopOff checks for outdated packages:
- **View Update History** — See recently updated packages with version changes

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Every hour | Check every 60 minutes |
| Every 4 hours | Default setting |
| Every 12 hours | Check twice daily |
| Every 24 hours | Check once daily |
| Manual only | Only check when you click "Check for Updates" |

## What's the difference between Update All and Greedy?

Some casks (Chrome, Slack, VSCode, etc.) have built-in auto-update and are normally skipped by Homebrew. Greedy mode tells Homebrew to update them anyway.

**By default**, TopOff gives you both options:

| Button | Command | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Update All | `brew upgrade` | Updates packages that don't auto-update themselves |
| Update All (Greedy) | `brew upgrade`, then `brew upgrade --greedy` | Updates everything, including apps that auto-update |

Scheduled background checks use normal mode, so those auto-updating apps won't show up as outdated.

**With Greedy Mode enabled** (in Options), TopOff switches to greedy everywhere:

- Scheduled checks use `brew outdated --greedy` so auto-updating apps appear as outdated
- The normal "Update All" button is hidden since "Update All (Greedy)" covers everything
- This is ideal if you prefer Homebrew to manage all your app updates in one place

Greedy Mode is off by default. You can toggle it anytime under **Options > Greedy Mode**.

## Privacy & Network Connections

TopOff makes only one network connection:

- **GitHub API** (`api.github.com`) — Checks for new TopOff releases on launch and periodically while running

That's it. No analytics, no telemetry, no tracking.

### Why does my firewall show other connections?

If you use a firewall like Little Snitch or Lulu, you may see TopOff associated with connections to other servers (e.g., InfluxData, Google, etc.). **These connections are from Homebrew, not TopOff.**

When TopOff runs `brew update` or `brew upgrade`, it spawns Homebrew as a child process. Firewalls often attribute child process network activity to the parent app. These connections may come from:

- Homebrew's own analytics (can be disabled with `brew analytics off`)
- Specific formulas or casks being updated that have telemetry
- Package download servers

You can safely allow or deny these connections based on your preferences — denying them won't affect TopOff's functionality.
